# pomodofi

Pomodofi is a minimalist Pomodoro timer built for focus and calm productivity. It features soothing backgrounds, fullscreen mode, and streams relaxing lo-fi music directly from YouTube to keep you in the zone. Perfect for study, work, or deep focus sessions.

The responsiveness and the backend are still work in progress.
